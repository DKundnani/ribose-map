## Project Overview
**Goal**: To create a user-friendly bioinformatics toolkit to analyze ribose-seq libraries

<p align="justify">
<b>Background</b>: The original scripts used to analyze ribose-seq libraries required proprietary software that is not readily available to many users, Platform Load Sharing Facility (LSF) workload management software.  To enable users to efficiently analyze their ribose-seq libraries, I have created Ribose-Map, a bioinformatics toolkit to analyze ribose-seq libraries.  With minimal software dependencies, environment set-up, and comprehensive documentation, Ribose-Map allows users to readily profile the identity and distribution of rNMPs in any organism of interest.  On this site, I have included documentation on how to automatically download the required input files, download and install the required software, and set up the appropriate directory structure (as a GitHub repository).
